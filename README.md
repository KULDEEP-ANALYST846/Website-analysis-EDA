### Website Analysis | Python

Comprehensive analysis of website user engagement and traffic patterns across multiple channels using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).

# Overview:
This project analyzes website user behavior and engagement across different days, hours, and traffic channels. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I performed data cleaning and visual exploration to identify peak activity times and highlight which channels drive the highest engagement. Insights are presented with clear heatmaps and bar charts to support smarter marketing and scheduling decisions.

# Problem Statement
- How do hour, day, and user channel affect website engagement and session quality?
- Can we identify high-impact periods and channels for optimized marketing?

# Dataset
- Source: Website export (CSV)
- Scope: 3,182 records covering April-May 2024
- Columns: channel group, datehour, Users, Sessions, Engaged sessions, Average engagement time per session, Engaged sessions per user, Events per session, Engagement rate, Event count

# Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Methods:
- Data cleaning & Transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Aggregations by time and channel

# Key Insights:
- Organic Social channel drives the Highest traffic late evenings (10â€“11 PM)
- Refferl Channel has the Highest Engagement Rate and Engagement Sessions.
- Engagement time and rates peak on weekdays, especially Wednesday
- Direct channel users have stronger conversion to engaged sessions
- Heatmaps reveal key windows for content scheduling

# Results & Conclusion:
